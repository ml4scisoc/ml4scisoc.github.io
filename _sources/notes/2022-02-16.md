## FAIRNESS AND MACHINE LEARNING
### Chapter 2: Classification 
Presented by Damon
#### Main Goal 
- determine plausible value for an unknown varible Y given an obscent variable X 
- Essentially trying to predict something based on other factors
#### Supervised learning
- The prevalent method for onstructing classifeirs from observed data
    - Goal: to identify menatingful patterns 
- Classifier: a mapping from the space of possible values for X to the space of values that the target Y can assume. 
- The essential idea is simple in that we will have albeld ata in the form (x1, y1) that is drawn from a distribtuion where x1 is an instance and y1 is the label. 
    - The instance are then partitioned into positive 
    - Lables typically come from a discrete set such as (-1, 1) in the case of binary classification. 
#### Statistical Classification Criteria 
- How to identify which classifer is best fo your purpose 
- Accuracy: the probability of correctly predicting the target variable 
- Cond. probability table 
    - The true positivie rate corresponds to the frequency of the classifer correctly assinging a positive label to a positive instance. 
- Why do we need the weighted average? 
    - P(Y=Ŷ) = P(Ŷ=1|Y=1)``P(Y=1)`` + P(Ŷ=0|Y=0)``P(Y=0)``
    - to get all of the accuracy, we need to multiple the weights to our conditional probabilities so that it is computable. 
#### The Conditional Expectation
- ```Score: a single real-valued variable summairzed from a regression model```
- A natural score function is the expectation of the target variable Y conditional on the features X we have observed 
#### Sensitive Characteristics (A)
- In many classification tasks, the features X contain or implicitly encode sensitive characteristics of an individual
- It is dangerous to ignore these factors, which will make prediction difficult by tampering the correlation. 
#### Indepdence -- R⏊A 
- Requires the sentitive charactieric to be statistically independent of the score
- ```Definition 1: The random variable (A, R) satisfy independence if A⏊R```
- Independence simplifies to the condition: 
    - ```P{R=1∣A=a}=P{R=1∣A=b}```
- Where R=1 is acceptance and the condition requires the acceptance rate to be the same in all groups. 
- There coudl also be a relaxation on the constraint that would introduce a positive amount of slack ε>- and require that: 
    - ```P{R=1∣A=a}≥P{R=1∣A=b} − ϵ```
    - ```= ϵ ≥ P{R=1∣A=b} - P{R=1∣A=a}```, where we want the difference to be small. 


#### Separation 
- Acknowledges that in many scenarios, the sensitive characteristic may be correlated with the target variable. 
- This separation criterion allows corelation between the score and the senstitive attribute to the extent that it is justified by the target variable
- ```Definition 2: Random variables (R,A,Y) satisfy separation if R⏊A|Y```
- In the case where R is a binary classifier, separation is equivalent to requiring for all groups a, b the two constraints: 
    - P{R=1∣Y=1,A=a}=P{R=1∣Y=1,A=b}
    - P{R=1∣Y=0,A=a}=P{R=1∣Y=0,A=b}

- Separation requires that all groups experience the same false negative rate and the same false positive rate.

#### Sufficiency -- Y⏊A|R
- Formalizes that the score already includes the sensitvie characteristic for the purpose of predicting the target 
- ```Definition 3: We say that random variables (R, A, Y) satistfy sufficienty if Y⏊A|R``` 
- In this case, a random variable R is sufficient for A iff for all groups a, b and all values r in the support of R, we have

- When R only has 2 values we recognize this condition as requiring a parity of pos./neg. predictive values across all groups.

#### Calibration and Sufficiency 
- It is sometimes desirable to be able to interpret the values of the score functions as probabilities 
- This condition means that the set of all instances assigned a score value r has an r fraction of positive instances among them. 

#### Calibration by Group 
- To formalize the connection between sufficiency and calibration we say that the score R satisfies calibration by group if it satisfies: ![](https://i.imgur.com/Jqv4jBb.png)
- ```Proposition 1. If a score R satisfies sufficiency, then there exists a function 𝓵: [0,1] --> [0,1] so that 𝓵(R) satisfies calibration by group. ```

#### Relationships Between Criteria 
- Initial criteria constrains the joint distribution in non-trivial ways therefore we can suspect that imposing any 2 of them simultaneously over-contrains the space to the point where only degenerate solutions remain.
- Happy path of establishing multiple fairnesses is intangible.
### Machine Bias 
Presented by Derek 
#### The premise 
- Brisha Borden & a friend - 18 years old 
    - Scooter
- Vernon Prater - "Seasoned"
    - Shoplifting 
- Both similar crimes 
- Computer program predicting likelihood of recidivism 
    - Borden > Prater 
    - Two years later, opposite held true 

#### Risk Assessments 
- Becoming increasingly more popular in courtrooms 
- 9 states provide scores to judges during sentencing 
#### Following the Warnings of AG Holder 
- The sentencing commission did not launch a study of risk scores 
- ProPublica did launch a study 
    - \>7000 people arrested in Broward Cty, FL 
    - Check how many were charged with new crimes over 2 years 
- Results 
    - Unreliable 
    - Biased 

#### In Theory 
- Risk scores are great 
- High scores mean more likely to commit crime 
- Vice versa for low scores 
- Simple...?
#### In Practice 
- People are extremely complex 
- Countless factors go into recidivism such as 
    - employment 
    - housing status 
    - fiancial situations 
- As a result unless we individualize the risk assessment, result will be biased 

#### The Problem 
- people tend to blindly trust tech. 
- any jurisdictions adopt Northpointe's software without testing 
- Using tech is the easy way out 
    - "Easy to use and gives 'simple/effective' charts for judicial review"
- 2009 study reported a 68% accruacy rate for the scoring software 
#### Overall 
- Using tech in social context is extremely complex 
- Poeple are unique and countless factors go into individual behavior 
- With recidivism specificialy 
    - Black people more likely to be predicted higher than White people 
    - Software relied upon too much 
    - Studies have concluded risk scores do not reflect reality. 

### Gender Shades 
Presented by Derek 
#### Intro 
- AI is widely used in society 
- Facial recognitiion software can realistically be used to identify suspects 
- Algo. trained with biased data result in algorithmic discrimination 
- This work focuses on facial recognition to gender classification

#### Related Work 
- Automated Facial Analysis 
- Benchmarks 
- Quality of models 
#### Intersectional Benchmark 
- Gender classification means we need defined classes 
- The dataset should contain varied phsyical attributes for subgroup accuracy analysis 
- Pilot Parliaments Benchmarks dataset 
    - high quality photos
    - reliable sources
#### Commercial Gender Classification Audit 
- Classifiers perform best on lighter, male faces 
- Classifiers perform worst on darker female faces 
    - Microsoft, IBM, Face++ analyzed 
- Max disparity in error rate between best/worst classified groups is 34.4% 

### Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations
Presented by Derek 
- Black people had to have more chronic conditions to have a higher risk score 
- Training used total medical expenditure. 
    - Could have used total sickness as a factor to train to avoid bias.
