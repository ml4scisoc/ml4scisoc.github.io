# Schedule



This course will proceed in three main parts: overview, deep dives, and conclusion.

## Structure

### Overview

In the first part of the course we will review ML basics, set norms for interaction and complete a survey of the topics that we will cover for the rest of the semester.  

In this part of the class, Professor Brown will lead synchronous sessions.  Students will be responsible for reading overviews, refreshing background material, and choosing an area for their course project. Students will start with an introductory demo or replication as a mini project.

### Deep Dives

During the middle of the course we will spend one week on each topic. There will be 1-3 papers to read each week.

Students will be responsible for presenting papers in class on a rotating basis.

During this time students will have milestones where they need to complete interim steps for their course project. The first milestone will be a proposal that includes the specific products for the remainder of the milestones based on a template.  


### Conclusion

<!-- In the end of the course, we will focus on integrating ideas across multiple topics. -->

We will wrap up by discussing students' projects in class time, giving substantive feedback prior to the final submissions.

Final projects will be evaluated through a presentation and paper.


## Weekly topics

The readings are subject to revision in class up until a presenter is assigned.
Topics may also be updated after the first few classes based on student interests
and recent publications.

```{warning}
The first two weeks will be as follows, other papers will liklely be adjusted based on student project topcss
```
