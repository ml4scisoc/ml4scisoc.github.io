# Learning Outcomes and Evaluation



This course has goals with respect to the knowledge and research skills.  

Evaluation will be with respect to each of the outcomes and based on a level of mastery: general awareness, competency, or mastery.


By the end of the course students will be able to:
- Critique common ways that social or scientific applications of ML require violating ML algorithm assumptions and ways to mitigate or adapt.
- Evaluate ML Research papers for their applicability to scientific and social applications of ML.
- Communicate about ML and its limitations work to varied audiences
- Apply ML to scientific and social data responsibly

## Use of AI

All work submitted in this course must be of quality and form expected for research publication.  

All work must adhere to the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)

All work must be clear, concise, and include appropriate citations. 


## Activities

- reading and evaluating ML research papers
- facilitating and participating in class discussions of the papers
- coproducing notes that summarized key points and open questions of papers
- producing a replication, demo, or illustration of one concept covered for a broader audience
- completing a project using ML in a scientific or social domain
- writing a CS conference style (short & concise) final paper on the project
<!-- - reflect on methodologies used in this type of research -->

<!-- - joint annotated bibliography -->

## Evaluation


The following describes each activity in the course and the specification for it. These specifications define how to get an A.  As each milestone approaches, more detailed information about evaluation will be provided as appropriate. 

### Discussions, Exercises, and Notes (20%)

For each topic we cover in class, you should engage fully in the class discussion
and practice exercises that are provided if applicable.

To demonstrate engagement you must:
- provide a good faith attempt at any exercises provided
- contribute to the discussion (comments and questions both count)
- contribute to annotated class notes

Each class session will be evaluated on if you contribute to discussion or not. This includes both asking questions and answering questions.


### Presentations (20%)


Presenting papers and participating in class will contribute to demonstrating a basic awareness at each of learning objective.

```{warning}
Dr. Brown will present the first few papers, to give an example
```

Each time you present  will be evaluated on specification, your presentation should:
- summarize the key takeaways for the reading(s) in your own words
- summarize key details for understanding to facilitate the discussion
- discussion of strengths and weaknesses of the paper & method
- describe how this paper relates to bigger ideas in the course and (if applicable) your own work

You'll present 2-3 times and you will be expected to improve each time, not to be perfect.  

When you present you don't have to have all the answers, you can have open questions.  
The goal is that you guide the discussion by doing the above and opening the floor up for questions.



### Project (60%)

The final project is a chance to dive deeply into one of the course topics. It has the following timeline. Percentages below are of the total grade.

### Proposal Specifications

Submit a 1.5- 2page proposal in the ACM Proceedings (2-column) format.  

Your proposal should include a concise problem statement, a preliminary literature review that situates your project, a description of method(s) you will use to answer your questions in your project, and the expected outcomes of your project. 



The proposal will be graded on if it meets the specification or not, but you will be able to revise and resubmit if the first submission does not. To meet specification it must:

- be the right length
- be the right format
- include all required sections
- be written clearly
- describe the problem, clearly identifying what the specific goals of your project are
- describe a tractable project
- summarize relevant literature for the problem context
- summarize relevant course-related literature for your project
- describe what you will do in your project (methods/process)
- describe the expected outcome of your project.


### Presentation Specifications

Your presentation should:
- include an agenda for the talk
- describe the problem
- summarize relevant background
- clearly identify what you did
- describe findings
- include concluding remarks on reflection/possible extensions
- be 15-20 minutes long

there will be a 5-10 minute Q&A after

### Paper Specifications

Your final paper should include a concise problem statement, a complete literature review that situates your project, a description of method(s) used your project, findings/r4esults, a discussion or future work section, and conclusion. 


For it to meet specification it must:
- be 4-5 pages + references
- be the right format
- include clearly marked sections indicating the required content
- be written clearly
- describe the problem, clearly identifying the specific goals of your project
- summarize relevant literature for the problem context
- summarize relevant course-related literature for your project
- include clear description of what was accomplished
- include a clear summary of results (may include null results/ failed findings)
- include a conclusion that suggests possible next directions


### Reflection

You will also submit a short reflection outside of your paper

- summarize what you learned in your project
- any challenges and how you over came them/ or wish you had asked for more help


<!-- ## Translation Mini Project 

For one paper that you present, you will produce a short demo, illustration, or replication that makes some aspect of the the topic accessible for a broader audience.


The demo will be graded on specification and can be revised and resubmitted one time.
Your demo must:
- describe a topic accurately
- be accessible to the specified topic model
- meet the description in the proposal

With your demo or after, submit a one paragraph reflection describing what you learned doing this exercise.
The reflection will be graded on completion. -->
