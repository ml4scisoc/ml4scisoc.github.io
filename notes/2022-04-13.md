## Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) 
Presented by: Derek 

### Goal: 
- accessibility 
- customization 
- plug-in readiness 
- global quantification 
- interpret High Dimensional E 



### Related Work 
- restrict ourselves to interpretable models like decision trees 
- post process models to gain insight 


### TCAV Overall 
- starts with image recognition 
classification 
- TCAV looks at one of the layers in classification model to extract the role of the layers in the model 

### Methods 
Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)
- given a set of examples representing a concept of human interest, find a vector in activations of a layer in the neural network that represents this concept 

### Directional Derivatives and Conceptual Sensitivity 
- use gradients to find derivatives of logits for data points. 
- This derivative is used to gauge sensitivity of an output class to changes in magnitude of a pixel 
- CAVs used with derivative to gauge sensitivity of ML predictions to changes in inputs towards the direction of a concept at a given layer.

### Testing with CAV 
-	Uses derivatives to compute conceptual sensitivity across classes of inputs 

#### Statistical Significance Testing 
-	TCAV could learn a meaningless CAV 
-	Thus, a CAV is trained many times to tell us if it was significant (about 500 times) 

#### Relative TCAV 
-	Allow making fine-toothed comparisons 
-	More precise comparison
-	Could apply in areas like black vs dark brown hair in image classification 

### Conclusion 

-	RGB, simply concepts performed better in the lower levels 
-	TCAV closely mirrors concepts neural networks paid attention to. 
-	Step in creating a linear interpretation of the internal state of a deep learning model 
-	Could be useful for analysts as they correspond to intended concepts 
-	Applied to audio, video, sequences, other data or have applications other than interpretability like identifying adversarial examples even though they focused on imaged classification in this paper
