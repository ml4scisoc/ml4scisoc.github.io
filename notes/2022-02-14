## Missing Data as a Causal and Probabilistic Problem
Lead Scribe: Emmely
Presented by Lily
### Goal of paper 
- casuality of missing data
- recoverability
- Handling missing data
- using latent variabl models,
- finding plausible assumptions under which missing data
### Missing Graphs and Missing Models
#### Definition 1
- A missingness mode lis this really a particular type of a grpahocal casual model were we only define interventions on a subset of variables
- DAG, in order to be a missigness graph, 
- needs a set of vertices
- contain observed variables, proxy variables
### Recoverability
- under the settings of MNAR
#### Lemma 1
- missingness as a causible inference problem because allows to rephrase recoverability as identifiability of casual effects
- can recover model if we can idetify the cause of the missing base
#### Theorem 1 & 2
- theorem 1 known as a "truncated factorixation", "manipulated distribution" or "g-formula"
- theorem 2 known as the consistent property
 figure 1a example
- mcar assumption, allows to recover the underlying missing variable
- this assumtion is the missingness analogue of ignorability
- no cofounding variable between variable RX and proxy variable
#### Theorem 3
- no missing variable can be caused by indicator
- missingness doesnt cause any other missingness
### General Recoverability Algorithm
- for every element missingness indicator variable in the set of missingness indicator variables it tries to recover
- Using a subroutine DIR
#### Subroutine has (3) cases
- attempts to check ifindicators for missing parents of RM are non-parental non-descendants of RM
- recoverability of the conditional distribution for Rm is immediate
- its uses the other two cases to isolate RM and its parents into small subproblelms based on a particuale type of ancestrial set A*, or the clan D* of RM
